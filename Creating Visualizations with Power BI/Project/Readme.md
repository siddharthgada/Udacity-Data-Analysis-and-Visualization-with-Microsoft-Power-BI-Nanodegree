# 🐾 Waggle Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Data Analysis and Visualization using Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree with Udacity.  

**Waggle** is a company that creates smart fitness trackers for pets, such as the **Lapdog** and **Lapcat** devices. The goal of this project was to build a Power BI report and data model that allows executives to analyze product performance, customer insights and device usage across families and pets.  

The report integrates multiple datasets (devices, pets, families, tracking and date) and provides actionable insights into **Lapdog vs. Lapcat device performance**, **pet demographics** and **family-level details**.
