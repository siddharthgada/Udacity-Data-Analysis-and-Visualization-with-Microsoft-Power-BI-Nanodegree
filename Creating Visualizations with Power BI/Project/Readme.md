# 🐾 Waggle Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Data Analysis and Visualization using Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree with Udacity.  
The goal was to design an interactive, branded Power BI report for **Waggle** (a company that creates innovative pet activity trackers [Lapdog and Lapcat devices]), answering key business questions from the CEO and CMO while showcasing a variety of visualizations, slicers and advanced report features.  

The report integrates multiple datasets (devices, pets, families, tracking and date) and provides actionable insights into **Lapdog vs. Lapcat device performance**, **pet demographics** and **family-level details**.
