# 📊 Power BI Course 3 (Creating Visualizations with Power BI) — Demos & Exercises

This repository contains my **practice work** from Course 3 of the Nanodegree program. The files here include exercises and demo tabs that helped me build confidence with advanced Power BI concepts before completing the final project (Waggle Report).

## 📂 Project Contents
- **Demos_Exercises_File.pdf** — A consolidated export of the demo dashboards and exercise reports created during the course.
- **Demos_Exercises_File.pbix** — Contain the live interactive versions of the practice dashboards.

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Practiced
Through these demos and exercises, I practiced:
- Creating and customizing a **Power BI theme** using JSON.
- Building and formatting common visuals: bar charts, line charts, donut charts, cards, scatter plots and maps.
- Applying **filters and slicers** (drop-down, slider, hierarchy and select-all).
- Designing intuitive layouts with buttons for **navigation and interaction**.
- Using **bookmarks** to toggle visuals and reset filters.
- Incorporating **interactivity and storytelling** in reports.
- Practicing **data preparation** and building relationships for structured analysis.

## 📖 Purpose
These exercises served as guided practice to reinforce:
1. Building a variety of visualizations with business relevance.  
2. Applying layout, accessibility and branding best practices.  
3. Leveraging interactivity (slicers, bookmarks, drill-throughs) to improve usability.  

They directly supported the skills needed to complete the **Waggle final project**, where all concepts were applied in a real-world business scenario.
