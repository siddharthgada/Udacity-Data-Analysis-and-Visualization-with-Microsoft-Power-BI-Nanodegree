# 📊 Market Analysis & Targeted Marketing Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer sales, income, demographics, and product trends for a **national clothing chain** using **Power BI, DAX and Power Query**. The goal was to design a **targeted marketing strategy** by identifying which products should be marketed to which customers, based on their income and spending patterns.  

Key highlights:  
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to explore relationships between sales, income, ratings, returns, and customer demographics  
- Used **DAX measures** for advanced calculations and **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformations  
- Applied regression modeling to predict customer income and segmentation to group customers by income and age  
- Designed visuals to support decision-making, including scatter plots, recommendation tables, and geographic maps/heat maps

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Strong positive correlation (R² = 0.78)** between customer sales and income → reliable predictor for targeted campaigns  
  - **Regression formula:** Predicted Income = 72.43 * (Customer Sales) + 72,638.21  

- **Moderate negative correlation (R² = 0.69)** between product returns and customer ratings → reducing returns can improve satisfaction  

- **Product targeting strategy:**  
  - **Shirts** → broad campaigns for low-to-medium income customers  
  - **Sweaters** → upsell for medium-spending customers  
  - **Leather Bags** → premium targeting for high-income customers
