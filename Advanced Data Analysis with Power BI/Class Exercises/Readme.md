Through these demos and exercises, I practiced:  

- **Defining business problems and constructing analytical questions**  
- **Retrieving, cleaning, and transforming data** using **Power Query and the M language**  
- Writing custom **DAX formulas** to create calculated measures, columns, and tables

- Building **structured data models** with relationships for efficient analysis  
- Creating **advanced visualizations** to analyze and present information  
- Designing **interactive dashboards** with slicers, drill-throughs, and bookmarks

## 📖 Purpose
These exercises served as guided practice to reinforce:  

- Applying **the full analytics workflow**: problem definition → data retrieval → cleaning → analysis → visualization → drawing conclusions  
- Leveraging **Power Query** for data preparation and transformation  
- Using **DAX** to measure, analyze, and understand business data  
- Designing **interactive and intuitive dashboards** for insights and decision-making  

They directly supported the skills needed to complete the **final project**, where all concepts were applied in a practical, business-focused scenario.
